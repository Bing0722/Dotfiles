# Nvim Configuration

Note: This Neovim setup is sufficient for my daily programming and learning, and I will continue to improve it in the future.

A starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).
Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started.
